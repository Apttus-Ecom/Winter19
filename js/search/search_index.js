component includes two date input fields one for start date and one for end date. The input fields use the ngx-bootstrap date picker component.\nBy default the date range component will calculate the begining and ending date for the cart item that is passed to it based on the frequency and term of the product.\nWhen the user selects a date in the start date or end date inputs the onStartDateChange and onEndDateChange methods will be fired respectively.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { InputDateModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [InputDateModule, ...]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n    \n\n\n    \n

The cart icon should be displayed in a fixed header of a page so it is accessible to the user at all times. Once items have been added to the user's current cart a badge will appear next to the Mini Cart icon with the total number of items.\nWhen a user clicks the Mini Cart icon the associated dropdown menu will be displayed. The Mini Cart dropdown menu shows the current line items that have been added to the cart. Line items include information about the product, controls for updating the quantity of items, and a control for removing the item from the cart. A cart total price and checkout button are also shown in the Mini Cart dropdown.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { MiniCartModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [MiniCartModule,

The intended audience are developers who will be creating and maintaining new storefronts on a Salesforce Apttus installation. If you haven't already, please contact Apttus to get the E-Commerce package installed in your org prior to installation.\nCreate your first Storefront\nThe Apttus E-Commerce SDK is intended to work with the unified data model of the underlying Apttus Quote-to-cash platform. This means, there are no additional data setup steps in order to create and maintain your catalog within Apttus outside of what you may already do if you use Apttus CPQ. That said, this guide assumes you have already created data for the following within Apttus:\n\nCategory\nProduct\nPrice List\n\nCommunity Setup\nThe Apttus E-Commerce platform leverages a Salesforce Community to provide authentication and hosting features for guest users. After the e-commerce package is deployed, the next step is to create a Salesforce Community. At minimum, you just need the community URL. However, if you intend to support guest users, you will need to enable that within the community settings. After deployment, the angular library will provide a Visualforce page that you can set as the default page for all page settings within the community (i.e home, login, forgot password, change password etc). Being that its a single page application, it is designed to handle all incoming requests.\nStorefront Object\nApart from the underlying catalog, the E-Commerce package comes with a store object and tab to map a storefront to a catalog. If you are using an Apttus MDO org, there may already be a 'store' object installed. This object is deprecated in favor of the 'Storefront' object that comes with the E-Commerce package.\nAfter your catalog has been setup within Apttus, the next step is to create a 'Storefront' record. The storefront object is very basic and contains only a couple fields to map a storefront to a price list and logo for the guest user. The price list should look up to the price list you want the guest user to access and the logo should be an id or a url of the logo attachment for the store. The storefront record also has a 'banner' related list that can be used to setup banners for the jumbotron component in the reference template.  Remember the name of the storefront you created. This will be used in a later step to associate with a storefront codebase.\nApttus Ecommerce Permission Set\nThe E-Commerce package comes with a basic permission set for providing the necessary access to users. The permission set is named 'Apttus Ecommerce' and should be assigned to users access the e-commerce storefront. If you would like to make any changes to the permissions, you may clone the permission set and make any changes necessary. \nAngular Library Installation\nIn order to install the apttus ecommerce libraries, you must first be granted access. Please reach out to Apttus support for obtaining access to this libraries.\nTo install all required libraries, run:\nnpm install --save @apttus/core @apttus/ecommerce @apttus/elementsAppModule.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\n\nimport { ApttusModule } from '@apttus/core';\nimport { CommerceModule, TranslatorLoaderService } from '@apttus/ecommerce';\n\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\nimport { ComponentModule } from './components/component.module';\nimport { RouteGuard } from './services/route.guard';\nimport { AuthGuard } from './services/auth.guard';\nimport { ConfigureGuard } from './services/configure.guard';\nimport { ConstraintRuleGuard } from './services/constraint-rule.guard';\n\n// Register locale data\nimport localeMx from '@angular/common/locales/es-MX';\nimport localeMxExtra from '@angular/common/locales/extra/es-MX';\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr';\nimport localeFrExtra from '@angular/common/locales/extra/fr';\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\nimport { ServiceWorkerModule } from '@angular/service-worker';\nimport { ModalModule } from 'ngx-bootstrap/modal';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\nimport { ProductDrawerModule, ApttusModalModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n// If using additional locales, register the locale data here\nregisterLocaleData(localeMx, 'es-MX', localeMxExtra);\nregisterLocaleData(localeFr, 'fr-FR', localeFrExtra);\n\n// Translations\nimport { TranslateModule, TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { AboGuard } from './services/aboGuard';\nimport { OrderDetailsGuard } from '@apttus/ecommerce';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n    // Pass environment file to ApttusModule.\n    ApttusModule.forRoot(environment),\n    // Pass the string name of the APTSMD_Store__c record you want to use to the CommerceModule.\n    CommerceModule.forRoot('My Store'),\n    ProductDrawerModule,\n    ModalModule.forRoot(),\n    ApttusModalModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: TranslatorLoaderService }\n    }),\n    HttpClientModule,\n    ComponentModule,\n    ServiceWorkerModule,\n    ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })\n  ],\n  providers: [RouteGuard, AuthGuard, AboGuard, ConfigureGuard, ConstraintRuleGuard, OrderDetailsGuard],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:\nDefining a model\nProper state management is crucial to a successful Angular PWA. To that end, accessing data within Salesforce requires you to define your model\nwithin a Typescript class. Behind the scenes, @apttus/core is managing how your components access and interact with that data to avoid uncessary\noperations and maintain synchronicity. \nHere's an example that defines the account and contact relationship for a component.\nimport { AObject, ATable, AField } from '@apttus/core';\n\n// We use the decorator ATable to tell @apttus/core this class maps to the 'Account' object.\n// In order to access standard sObject fields, our Account class must extend 'AObject' (a subclass of 'SObject).\n// The class name can be anything, but the sobjectName and aqlName properties in the ATable decorator must map\n// to an object API name within Salesforce or AIC respectively.\n@ATable({\n  sobjectName : 'Account',\n  aqlName: 'crm_Account'\n})\nexport class Account extends AObject {\n\n  // Similar to how the ATable decorator is used on model objects the AField decorator is used for fields within the model.\n  // The soql and aql properties must map to a field API name in Salesforce or AIC respectively.\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'Name',\n    aql: 'Name'\n  })\n  public Name: string = null;\n\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'BillingStreet',\n    aql: 'BillingStreet'\n  })\n  BillingStreet: string = null;\n\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'My_Custom_Field__c'\n  })\n  public MyCustomField: number = null;\n\n  //Related Lists\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'PriceListId__r',\n    aql: 'DefaultPriceListId'\n  })\n  PriceList: PriceList = new PriceList();\n}Defining a Service\nAfter defining your model, you can access the data by creating a service for the models. The AObjectService class contains many of the standard DML and query operations to access the data, however you may add\nany convenience methods you want to your service. The core service methods are usually very simple.\nimport { AObjectService } from '@apttus/core';\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts'  // This is a reference to the account model created in the previous section\n\n\n@Injectable({\n    providedIn : 'root'\n})\nexport class AccountService extends AObjectService{\n  //Add service methods here\n  type = Account;\n}Access the data in your component\nimport { Component, OnOnit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AccountService } from './account.service.ts';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts';\n\n@Component({\n  selector : 'app-account',\n  template : `\n\n  `,\n  styles : [``]\n})\nexport class AccountComponent implements OnInit{\n\n  constructor(private accountService: AccountService){}\n\n  // Always perform service methods in the ngOnInit method\n  ngOnInit(){\n    this.accountService.where([new ACondition(this.accountService.type, 'Id', 'NotNull', null)], 'AND', null, null, new APageInfo(1, 1)).subscribe(res => {\n      /*\n        res === [\n          {\n            Name: 'Account A',\n            BillingStreet: '1234 Main Street',\n            MyCustomField: 44,\n            PriceList: {\n              ...\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      */\n    });\n    this.accountService.describe(Account, 'MyCustomField', false).subscribe(res => {\n      // Describe information for My_Custom_Field__c\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.search('Main street').subscribe(res => {\n      // SOSL Search Results\n      // Note : search does not follow the model pattern and will return results specified in the query\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.get(['00Fxxxxxxx', '00Fxxxxxxx']).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns an array of account records\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.aggregate([new ACondition(this.accountService.type, 'Id', 'NotNull', null)]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns aggregates for the specified clause. (i.e. total records as well as max/min values for all \n      // fields specified in the model)\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.create([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of id's created\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.update([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of id's updated\n    })  \n\n    this.accountService.upsert([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of objects upserted\n    }) \n\n    this.accountService.delete([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of boolean values for accounts that were successfully deleted\n    })\n  }\n}\ndeploy\nTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run lintTo deploy your code to your salesforce org\n$ npm run deploy\n# Known Issues\n\n\n@Angular/cli 6.0.0 Can't Resolve Stream\nIf you've upgraded to @angular/cli 6, and you're seeing the following error\nWARNING in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/xml2js/node_modules/sax/lib/sax.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\xml2js\\node_modules\\sax\\lib'\n\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/csv-parse/lib/index.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\csv-parse\\lib'\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/csv-stringify/lib/index.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\csv-stringify\\lib'\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/xml2js/lib/parser.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'timers' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\xml2js\\lib'\ni ｢wdm｣: Failed to compile.Fix: Add path\nAdd the following to your tsconfig.app.json file under 'compilerOptions':\n\"paths\" : {\n  \"jsforce\" : [\"./node_modules/jsforce/build/jsforce.min.js\"]\n  ...\n}\n\nUncaught Error: No base href set.

These libraries include:\n\n@angular/cdk@^7.3.7\nlodash-decorators@^6.0.1\nngx-indexed-db@^2.0.8\nngx-scrollbar^4.2.0\n\nThese libraries can be installed and saved to the package.json file with the following command.\n$ npm install @angular/cdk@^7.3.7 lodash-decorators@^6.0.1 ngx-indexed-db@^2.0.8 ngx-scrollbar^4.2.0 --saveInstall the New Libraries\nRun the following command to install the Apttus libraries for the Summer 2019 release from npm.\n$ npm installNew Service Locations\nSome services that were in the @apttus/constraint-rules, @apttus/abo, and @apttus/promotion libraries have been moved into @apttus/ecommerce. This will require imports to be changed from within component typescript files.\nCartService method updates\nThe CartService has been updated and some of the previous methods have either been renamed, inputs refactored, or moved to another service. Make the following changes throughout your application:\n\nrefreshCart() method now accepts no arguments.\nupdateQuantity() method has been renamed to updateCartItems().\ngetCartItem() method has been moved to the CartItemService and is named getCartItemsForProduct() which returns an Observable array of CartItem objects.\n\nComponent Updates\nSome components have been updated with different inputs which will need to be changed in order to work with the new libraries.\nInputSelectComponent\nThe InputSelectComponent no longer uses describe information to form the list of select options. The updated version of the component simply takes in a list of elements and uses them for the select. Use the picklistValues input to pass in your list of values.\n\nProductCardComponent\nThe ProductCardComponent no longer has a constraintRuleList input. This must be removed from existing templates.\n\nPriceComponent\nThe PriceComponent no longer has the options or attributes inputs. New inputs include:\n\nattributeValue\nbundle\nterm\n\n\nAddToCartComponent\nThe AddToCartComponent no longer has the productAttributes, productOptions, or constraintRuleList inputs.\n\nProductConfigurationComponent\nAll inputs for the ProductConfigurationComponent have changed. Please view the component documentation for details on how to use this component.\n\nProductConfigurationSummaryComponent\nAll inputs for the ProductConfigurationSummaryComponent have changed. Please view the component documentation for details on how to use this component.\n\nPromotionAppliedtoLineitemComponent\nThe PromotionAppliedtoLineitemComponent has been removed.\n\nPromotionComponent\nThe PromotionComponent has changed the name of its input from appliedpromos to cart.\n\nAssetListComponent\nThe assets input on AssetListComponent has removed. The pageAssets input now accepts an array of AccordionRows objects instead of an array of AssetLineItems.\nFile Updates\nenvironment.ts & environment.prod.ts\nChange the name of the property cartDebounceTime to debounceTime.\nAdd the following properties to your configuration file:\n  ...\n  sentryDsn: null,\n  useIndexedDB: true,\n  ...Note: The useIndexDB: true property may not be required after patch fixes are implemented. If you are getting the error Cannot read property 'delete' of undefined at CacheService.push this will fix that error.\n\nangular.json\nAdd the following block of code to the project assets section.\n  {\n    \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n    \"input\": \"./node_modules/crypto-js\",\n    \"output\": \"./assets/scripts/\"\n  }Here is an expanded view to show the exact location where this should be added.\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"reference-base\": {\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"options\": {\n            \"assets\": [\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\n              \"src/assets\",\n              \"src/manifest.json\",\n              \"src/apttus-worker.js\",\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                \"input\": \"./node_modules/crypto-js\",\n                \"output\": \"./assets/scripts/\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}Default Template Specific Changes\nIf you are using the default template the following is a list of all the files that must be updated with the changes needed in order to use the new Apttus libraries.\napp.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nConstraintRulesModule\nPromotionModule\nAboModule\n\n\napp.component.ts\nIf you are using the default template remove this block of code from the app.component.ts file's ngOnInit() method.\nthis.subs.push(this.platformService.onRefreshHome.subscribe(res => {\n  if (res) {\n    this.router.navigateByUrl('/');\n    localStorage.setItem('Show Toastr', 'true');\n    window.location.reload();\n  }\n}));\n\nif (localStorage.getItem('Show Toastr')) {\n  if (localStorage.getItem('Show Toastr').valueOf()) {\n    setTimeout(() => this.toastr.warning('This page has been reloaded.', 'Session Expired'));\n    localStorage.removeItem('Show Toastr');\n  }\n}\ncomponent.module\nRemove the following modules:\n\nAboModule\nStoreModule\nCartModule\nPricingModule\nCatalogModule\nCrmModule\nConstraintRulesModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\ncart.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCartModule as cModule\nStoreModule\nPricingModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\ncompare.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCartModule\nStoreModule\nCatalogModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\ndetails.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nPromotionAppliedtoLineitemModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\nhome.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCatalogModule\nStoreModule\nConstraintRulesModule\n\n\ninstalled-products.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCatalogModule\nStoreModule\nAboModule\n\n\nmanage-cart.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCatalogModule\nStoreModule\nAboModule\nCartModule\nPromotionAppliedtoLineitemModule\nConstraintRulesModule\n\n\nmy-account.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nStoreModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\nproduct-details.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCatalogModule\nStoreModule\nCartModule\nConstraintRulesModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\nproduct-list.module.ts\nRemove the following modules:\n\nCatalogModule\nStoreModule\nAboModule\nConstraintRulesModule\n\nRename the MdSpinnerModule to IconModule\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
